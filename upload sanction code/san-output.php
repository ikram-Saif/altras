            <p>
                 Money laundering is the process by which criminally obtained money or other assets are exchanged for “clean” money with no obvious link to its criminal origin. It also covers money, however obtained, which is used to fund terrorism. Money laundering is a serious threat to financial system of all countries, and it leads to destruction of the country’s sovereignty and character. This has been widely recognised at the international level. The recognition has culminated in concerted efforts all over the world to fight this ultra-criminal activity thru enactment of stringent laws, regulations and measures aimed at securing financial systems against money laundering.

                Altras International Ltd views money laundering as a serious criminal offence, and as such, complies with the FCA and HMRC regulatory requirements intended to prevent money laundering.
