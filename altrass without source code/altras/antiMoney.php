            <h3>MONEY LAUNDERING STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>
            Money laundering is the process by which criminally obtained money or other assets are exchanged for “clean” money with no obvious link to its criminal origin. Likewise, terrorist financing involves the solicitation, collection or provision of funds with the intention that they may be used to support terrorist acts or organisations. Funds may stem from both legal and illicit sources. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As an Authorised Payment Institution, Altras International Ltd recognises that, we are at risk of being exploited by money launderers.
