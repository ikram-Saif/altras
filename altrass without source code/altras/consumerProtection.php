            <h3>Our help to you to protect yourself from fraud:</h3>

            <p>You work hard for your money and you want a company you can rely on when it comes to
sending your money to friends and family. That is why we want to help you protect yourself
from fraud. In this section, you will find informative tips and other useful material to stay
informed and help reduce your chances of falling victim to scammers.</p>
            <p>Lower your chances of falling victim to fraud by checking out these eight things you should
never do when using a money transfer service:</p> 
        <ol>
        <li>Never send money to people you have not met in-person.</li>
        <li>Never send money to pay for taxes or fees on lottery or prize winnings.</li>
        <li>Never use a test question as an additional security measure to protect your transaction.</li>
        <li>Never provide your banking information to people or businesses you do not know.</li>
        <li>Never send money in advance to obtain a loan or credit card.</li>
        <li>Never send money for an emergency without verifying that it is a real emergency.</li>
        <li>Never send funds from a check in your account until it officially clears-which can takeweeks.</li>
        <li> Never send a money transfer for online purchases.</li>
        </ol>
            <h3>Tips to help you to avoid falling victim to relationship scam:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Only send money to people you personally know and trust and, in this case, have met in
                person. Be especially cautious with people you meet online, even if you correspond with them
                via email or phone.
                </li>
                <li>Be wary of anyone who asks you to leave the dating website immediately to continue your
                conversation through email or IM, says the Federal Trade Commission in their guide to
                avoiding online dating scams. This allows fraudsters to carry out their scam without the dating
                site having a record of your encounter.</li>

                <li>Be cautious if someone claims to be from the United Kingdom but is currently overseas.
                Fraudsters often use offshore accounts, making it more difficult for authorities to track them
                down and catch them.
                </li>

                <li>Never give your banking information to unknown individuals or businesses.</li>
                <li>Verify every emergency before sending money.</li>
                <li>Fraudsters can trick their victims in a variety of ways. Sometimes they instantly express
                    feelings of love and other times they lead their victims along. No matter how much your
                    relationship might seem like the real thing, you should be suspicious if someone starts asking
                    for information like credit card or Social Security numbers.
                </li>
            </ol>
<h3>Tips to help you to a void failing victim to the employment scam:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Be sceptical of any job offer where you must pay money up front.</li>
    <li>Never send money from a deposited check until it officially clears. Just because funds are
    available does not mean a check has cleared-by law, banks must make deposited funds
    available within a few days, but it can take weeks to uncover a fake check.</li>
    <li>If you are communicating with anyone by email, check for common red flags like poor
    grammar, misspellings, character/spacing mistakes, and excessive capitalization. Look for use
    of generic email addresses rather than specific business email addresses.</li>

    <li>Be cautious when dealing with people who say they currently live overseas or are out of
    the country on business. Scammers tell victims this to explain why they cannot meet in
    person. Also be wary if they prefer to communicate via email only.</li>
    <li>Do your research. Check with your local consumer protection agency, state Attorney
    General’s Office, and the Better Business Bureau to see if the company you are dealing with
    has any complaints filed against them.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips to help you to avoid falling victim to the lottery – prize scam:
</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Never send money to pay for taxes or fees on lottery or prize winnings. Legitimate
sweepstakes do not require you to pay or buy something to enter or improve your chances
of winning, or to pay taxes or processing fees to get your prize.
    </li>
    <li>Never give your banking information to unknown individuals or businesses.</li>
    <li>Never withdraw or send funds from a check in your account until it officially clears, which
can take weeks.
    </li
    ><li>Do your research. Check out the company that contacted you with local law enforcement
or a consumer protection agency like the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade
Commission, or other trusted sources.
    </li>
    <li>Read the fine print legitimate offers clearly disclose the terms and conditions of the
promotion, including the rules, how the entry process works, and your odds of winning.
</li>
<li>Do not play the foreign lottery. It is illegal.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips to help you to avoid falling victim to over-payment scam:</h3>

<ol>
        <li>Know who you are doing business with; independently confirm your buyer’s name, street
        address, and telephone number.</li>
        <li>Do not accept a check or money order for more than your selling price. If the name on the
        check does not match the name of the person you are dealing with, immediately end the
        transaction.</li>
        <li>Consider dealing in cash and in-person with local buyers. If this is not feasible, ask for a
        check drawn on a local bank so you can visit a local branch or office to determine if the check
        is legitimate. Or consider an alternative method of payment like a trusted escrow service or
        online payment service.</li>
        <li>If a buyer insists that you wire money, do not. Scammers pressure people to use wire
        transfer services because the money’s picked up in cash and impossible to trace afterward.</li>
        <li>Fake checks or money orders play a starring role in overpayment scams, advance fee and
        prepayment scams, mystery shopping scams, lottery prize scams, and more. Don’t use these
        funds until your bank officially clears them and remember Banks must make deposited funds
        available within a few days, but it can take weeks to uncover a fake check.
        </li>
        <li>Resist pressure from a buyer to act immediately. If the buyer’s intentions are good, he or
        she will wait for the check to clear to finish the transaction.</li>
        <li>If you are communicating with anyone by email, check for common red flags like poor
        grammar, misspellings, character/spacing mistakes, and excessive capitalization.
        </li>
    </ol>
<h3>Tips to help you to avoid falling victim to the rental property scam:
</h3>
<ol>
        <li>If you are communicating by email, check for common red flags like poor grammar,
        misspellings, character/spacing mistakes, and excessive capitalization.</li>
    <li>Most renters want to see the property before they commit; if they do not, chances are you
        are dealing with a scammer. Another red flag is if they have an unusually strong sense of
        urgency to get you to rent or rent your property to them very early in communications with
        them.</li>
        <li>Be cautious when dealing with people who say they currently live overseas or are out of
            the country on business. Scammers tell victims this to explain why they cannot meet in
            person. Also be wary if they prefer to communicate via email only.</li>
        <li>Do notsend money to anyone you do not know and trust, especially people you have never
        met in person.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips to help you to avoid falling victim to the advance fee scam:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Be sceptical of any offer where you must pay money up front. Walk away if you are asked
    for money immediately, especially if it is for “insurance,” “processing,” or “paperwork.”

    </li>
    <li>If you are communicating with anyone by email, check for common red flags like poor
    grammar, misspellings, character/spacing mistakes, and excessive capitalization. Look for use
    of generic email addresses rather than specific business email addresses.</li>

    <li>Do your research.
    </li>
    <li>Be wary of businesses that operate using a post office box and do not have a street address.
    </li>
    <li>Check out the company that contacted you with local law enforcement or a consumer
    protection agency like the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, your State
    Attorney General’s Office, or other trusted sources.</li>

    <li>Check the company out independently by getting its phone number from a phone book or
    directory assistance and calling to confirm they are who they say they are.
    </li>
    <li>If you are checking out a lender or loan broker, they are required to register in the UK.
    </li>
